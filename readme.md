# Programming the Farming Drone (Report)
## Introduction
It is a game that can be run using a python code to farm and used for the growing of crops and unlock different varities of Entities. It is a game that will help while learning python because that has all codes of the python that we learn.

Write and explain your code along with recordings.
## Step 1: Farming on 1 tile
**Code:**
```python
while True:
if can_harvest():
    harvest()
```

**Explanation:**
The code runs an infinite number of times and harvest the grass with the if condition.

**Demo:**

**Notes**
- Using the code above I was able to get enough hay to unlock the tile
- These features were unlocked too: variables and functions.


## Step 2: Farming on 3x3 tile
**Code:**
```python
while True:
    if can_harvest():
        harvest()
        move(North)
    move(East)
``` 


**Explanation:**
The code makes the drone go one square at a time harvests the grass with the if condition.

## Step 3: Farming on 6x6 tile
**Code:**
```python
# Code to go around and farm bush
while True:
    if can_harvest():
        fore i in range(get_world_size()):
            for j in range(get_world_size()):
                move(North)
                harvest()
                plant(Entities.Bush)
                plant(Entities.Carrots)
            move(East)
```

                move(North)
                harvest()
                till()
                use_item(Items.Fertilizer)
                get_water()
                trade(Items.Empty_Tank)
                use_items(Itemds.Water_Tank)
                plant(Entities.Tree)
            move(East)
    else:
        move(East)
```

**Notes**
- Using the code above I was able to get enough hay to unlock the tile
- These features were unlocked too: variables and functions.

# Challenges and Learnings
## Challenges
1. The challenges that i face when playing the game is that, it was hard to get entities and it was hard to grow the crops at a speed rate so i had to wait for the crops to grow. When wating for the crops to harvest the laptop was getting heated so, it was one of the challenges.

## Learnings
1. The things that i learned from the game is that i was able to get to learn about python code in a fun ways. Like i can learn codes without getting bored .
2. Also i learned some new codes for the first time, like codes that i havn't seen.
